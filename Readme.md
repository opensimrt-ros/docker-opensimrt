# docker opensimrt

![Docker Build Status](https://github.com/opensimrt-ros/docker-opensimrt/actions/workflows/docker-image.yml/badge.svg?branch=feature/newest_opensim)

This repository contains scripts for building and launching OpenSimRT with a ROS interface. It was initially based on the [CI yaml from OpenSimRT](https://github.com/mitkof6/OpenSimRT), but now we are building opensim (4.5.1 at the time this was written) from source. You might want to adapt the components and their versions to your own preferences

While it was meant to be used on Linux, it may be possible to use other Docker for Windows or Mac (see below). Also this is building for x86\_64, it may work for arm64 with some changes to the dockerfiles (by using the "FROM --platform=$TARGETPLATFORM <docker-image>"), but i don't have an arm system to test it and i am not going to setup a qemu or a crosscompilation system before there is a strong need for it (to make this run on an android device you would need to install a linux kernel on your phone/tablet to run docker and this is not something most people would be okay doing, so i see little use cases now).

To use it you need to have [docker installed](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/). Please either install docker in a rootfull way or the volume mounts won't work by default (it is easy to change the permissions of the folders with the root\_instance.sh script).

## Newest instructions:

Clone it like this to get everything:

    git clone --recursive -b devel-all git@github.com:opensimrt-ros/docker-opensimrt opensimrt

## Devices:

Currently tested are only the XIMU3 imu sensors and the Moticon Insoles. The network is simple with every IMU connected to a router and an android device (also connected via wifi to the router) which runs the Moticon app as an intermediate hop between the bluetooth insoles and the router. The data exchange is done with a python script that is an addon component which can be bought from Moticon. This may be the reason for the strange lags we have from the insole data and ideally we would want to make this more streamlined. I tested having a virtual machine and linking the tablet via USB to the pc, but both of those didn't seem to make much of a difference. Maybe my android device is slow. I will publish more data once I measure this more accurately and if I find out what is the best way I will make the appropriate changes. Currently, sometimes the insoles can get up to 7s delays and then normalize. I don't know how to solve it. Likely we want a proper bluetooth linux driver here. 

You may also want to add some delay to the TF reader (maybe like 10-20ms) in IK and physically calibrate the imus with the crosscorrelation algorithm (imu\_delay\_finder package), but i haven't done it, so there might be some bugs there. The IMUs run with stable 2-30ms delays and this is okay for the types of movements we are currently measuring. For faster things, this may be necessary. 

Another improvement that can be done to the network is setting up the linux pc as an AP so you have one less hop in the network. This will also make the whole system portable if you are running this on a laptop pc as I am. I might implement this in the future, it sounds cool. And if you set the SSID of your PC's wifi AP to the same as the one from the router, you can prevent having to change anything in the IMUs, I think. 

### How to setup the devices:

- IMUs

You need to change the IPs on the Ximu3s to static ips with the right numbering and maybe also the ports. I don't remember what exactly they are, look into the ximu3 launch files to make sure. Also the whole thing with incoming and outgoing ports is confusing to me, so if they have different IPs, the port can be the same, that probably makes somethings easier, but I didn't do that, i just set different ports for everything so I don't need to think. 

- Insoles

The insoles need to be able to contact the linux pc which will be listening on port 9999 (by default). So in the Moticon App you need to specify the IP for the linux host it's the network valid one for your wifi/ethernet adapter (docker will make a bunch of networking stuff (for virtual interfaces and bridges and so on and this will depend on your setup),  so it will look messy, and you need to know if you are using a wire or the wifi adapter ). do "hostname -I" or if you are getting confused look into "ifconfig" or the network manager/settings pane if you like guis. 

You will need the python SDK from Moticon as well. You need to buy this and the insoles to be able to use our code. This is a python thing reading protobuf messages and I wonder if it can be a source of delay. Python tends to be fast because it often just wraps C code that is fast, but I don't really know. 

Once you have this SDK, you need to copy it to the src/moticon\_insoles/sdk directory of the moticon\_insoles ros package (inside the catkin workspace). I think I wrote on the readme of that package how to do this. Btw, this package is not complete yet. The TFs are incorrect for the IMU driver and it currently will stop you from being able to use this IMU as an orientation source for IK. It is probably not to hard to fix, but changing this will break the current ID code and the URDF gait1992 model that was set to use the incorrect TFs. The insoles are also not rotating the way they should (they are mirrored for some reason), so I also need to figure out why that is. If you want to fix this, be my guest. 

### Running things:

You probably want to start the acquisition state machine from flexbe. There is a bunch of signals that need to happen for things to be initialized properly and I couldn't find an easier way yet to do this, hence this state machine. 

Currently I am using the insole\_upright behavior, but this is bound to change as well. 


## Final notes:

It is unfortunate that this system is not small enough for me to be on top of everything that needs to be fixed, so if it's not working, please open an issue so as to let me know. 

## Changelog:

12 Sep 24: moved this branch to opensim 4.5.1. Note that I haven't optimized this at all, so it is a massive docker image.  



#### Everything below here is old. needs to be reviewed and updated.

---


Build with :

    $ bash build_docker_image.sh

Run with:

    $ bash run_docker_image.sh
    
Note: currently the PS1 is set to look pretty (it can be confusing to know whether you are inside the docker instance or main machine). For that to work you need to install a Nerd font and set your terminal to use it. The font we use is DroidSansMono Nerd Font Mono, available [here](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/blob/master/patched-fonts/DroidSansMono/complete/Droid%20Sans%20Mono%20Nerd%20Font%20Complete%20Mono.otf).

# Structure

The code was devided into 2 different workspaces to reduce compilation times so opensimrt_core can be compiled during the build script and the main catkin workspace can be compiled at runtime. This allowed us to share catkin\_ws as a docker volume and make sure that code changes are not lost between multiple sessions.

# First time use:

We are now using a big repo with everything for the ease of it. 

create a directory called 

    mkdir -p catkin_devel/src

do a 

    git clone git@gits-15.sys.kth.se:frekle/ros_biomech.git

then do:

    git submodule update --init --recursive

## Troubleshooting:
	
I've done some shady things with the submodules here, so you might need to change .gitmodules and the .git/config file to put the correct reference for the tmux_session module. This was an old idea and it is quite complicated, so it will be phased out at some point (if I have time), but right now it is necessary. 


Run the docker image loader script: 

    $ bash run_docker_image.sh

Inside the docker run the script:

    $ first_time_catkin_builder.sh

You should be set to move to Usage.

## Manually getting the appropriate packages:

In case you don't want to download everything, you can instead create your catkin workspace yourself.

Run the docker image loader script: 

    $ bash run_docker_image.sh

Navigate to the directory ´/catkin_ws/src´ and get the appropriate repositories:

    $ git clone https://github.com/opensimrt-ros/osrt_ros.git -b devel
    $ git clone https://github.com/opensimrt-ros/opensimrt_msgs.git
    $ git clone https://github.com/opensimrt-ros/gait1992_description.git
    
If you want to use ALVAR:

    $ git clone https://github.com/machinekoder/ar_track_alvar.git -b noetic-devel
    $ git clone https://github.com/opensimrt-ros/ar_test -b fixing_cube
    
If you want to use a webcam as video input:

    $ git clone https://github.com/ros-drivers/usb_cam.git
   
If you want XIMU3 drivers:

    $ git clone https://github.com/opensimrt-ros/ximu3_ros.git

After getting all the relevant packages, you need to use the script to compile the workspace (it set's up some environment variables needed by opensimrt\_core and osrt\_ros):

    $ catkin_build_ws.bash 

# Usage: 

The demos are tmux sessions which load roscore and the necessary roslaunch files. Tmux was used to allow for easier debug. Neovim is also available for editing source code with YouCompleteMe installed for code completion. 

First source the workspace:
    
    $ source /catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash
    
And execute the launcher script:

    $ rosrun osrt_ros tmux_session_XXX
    
Where XXX is the particular demo. Use tab completion to list all available options.

## Existing examples:

- `tmux_session_ar.bash` Test ALVAR marker cube

- `tmux_session_test_agrf.bash` Test acceleration based state-machine GRFM predictions  

- `tmux_session_test_cgrf.bash` Test contact force based state-machine GRFM predictions

- `tmux_session_test_gait1992_visuals.bash` Test URDF model

- `tmux_session_test_id_agrf.bash` Test ID and acceleration based GRFM pipeline*

- `tmux_session_test_id_cgrf.bash` Test ID and contact-force based GRFM pipeline*

- `tmux_session_test_id_combined_agrf.bash` Test ID+SO and acceleration based GRFM pipeline*,**

- `tmux_session_test_id_combined_cgrf.bash` Test ID+SO and contact-force based GRFM pipeline*,**

- `tmux_session_test_single_ar_with_lowerbody.bash` Test ALVAR marker cube single input with static transforms to pelvis, lowerbody, only IK

- `tmux_session_test_single_ar_with_upperbody.bash` Test ALVAR marker cube single input with static transforms to pelvis, upperbody, only IK

- `tmux_session_test_single_ximu_with_lowerbody.bash` Test XIMU3 single input with static transforms to pelvis, lowerbody, only IK

- `tmux_session_test_single_ximu_with_upperbody.bash` Test XIMU3 single input with static transforms to pelvis, upperbody, only IK

\* Note here the filtering is still happening inside the node, so there is additional 35 samples wait until there are enough values for visualization

\*\* Here the speed of the playback is reduced to 33fps as the algorithm cannot run faster on our machine. Your machine likely has different specs, so change the rate\_divider accordingly to be able to reach convergence for every frame.

# Docker builds

## Latest build

The latest version of the ros/docker available can be downloaded with:

    docker pull rosopensimrt/ros

To run the docker you just downloaded you need X forwarding to work, so 

    xhost +
    
Under linux it can then be run with:

	docker run --rm -it \
		-p 9000:9000/udp \
		-p 8001:8001/udp \
		-p 10000:10000/udp \
		-e DISPLAY=$DISPLAY -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix \
		--name=opensimrt_ros \
		--device=/dev/dri:/dev/dri \
		--device=/dev/video0:/dev/video0 \
		-v $(pwd)/catkin_ws:/catkin_ws \
		-v $(pwd)/tmux:/usr/local/bin/tmux_session\
		rosopensimrt/ros:latest /bin/bash

## Older builds

If instead you just want to use the older already built docker images, you can get them [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/mysablehats/opensim-rt/tags). We are not freezing versions, so it is possible that the builder script will break in the future. 

The docker with the default version from mitkof6/OpenSIMRT can be obtained with: 

     docker pull mysablehats/opensim-rt:main

It can also be directly accessed [here](https://hub.docker.com/layers/mysablehats/opensim-rt/main/images/sha256-f3f238759e736f2fd01b9a1eec307b9dbe664f97206e438541bb2685b9fcb38e).

# Using AR

Your camera needs to be calibrated and the fiducials need to be printed. More details in https://github.com/opensimrt-ros/ar_test

# XIMU port forwarding

To use XIMU3 sensors with WiFi, docker needs to be able to access the appropriate ports. Those need to be setup correctly in the "run\_docker\_image.sh" script and possibly in the ros.Dockerfile.

# Windows and Mac users

Currently the visualizations (either from rViz or from OpenSim) are using X, so to be able to see visual output you will need an X server. Docker networking with ROS can be tricky and we provide no support for those cases. If you know what you are doing, you can forward the topics to another Linux PC with ROS natively installed or even do your own visualization using the ROS implementation under the hood (say with an additional node serving as a tunnel). 

## Windows Users:

To show graphics make sure you have either Xming or vcxsrv installed and running. 

Xming and vcxsrv will be running on the WSL ip address of your computer. You can check this IP by either opening a CMD (windows key + R then type cmd, in command prompt type ipconfig and use the IP from WSL) or by checking the log file from xming/ vcxsrv.

This ip will be used to set the DISPLAY variable which will run inside the docker as

    $ export DISPLAY=172.23.64.1:0.0

Or whatever your ip is. 

### Known issues

Showing OpenSim graphics in Linux uses X forwarding with hardware acceleration. This is not available in Windows (as far as I know) and may the reason why running the Docker inside Windows has such slow performance.

## Mac Users:

The X server for MacOS is XQuartz. It may have the same limitations as Windows visualization, but this has not been tested.
